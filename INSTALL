Installations instructions for SMB for FUSE
===============================================================================

Installation/compiling
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile type:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ su

(enter root password)
 # make install

In case you define a custom install path, make sure that the path to the
installed executables - fusesmb and fusesmb.cache - are in your $PATH .

Running
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run SMB for FUSE type - as normal user:

 $ fusesmb <mountpoint>

On the first run your network will be scanned for available servers. This could
take a while depending on the number of computers in your network.

When scanning is finished you can now enter the <mountpoint> to browse your
network.

Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you need authentication you can edit the file ~/.smb/fusesmb.conf . An
example of this file with comments for every available option is shown in
fusesmb.conf.ex .


Note for users of previous versions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SMB for FUSE doesn't use cron anymore for network scanning. You can remove the
scanner from your crontab by typing:

 $ crontab -e

Then delete the line containing fusesmbcache.

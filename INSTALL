Installation
============

./configure
make
make install

if this succeeds then add an entry to your crontab:
using crontab -e adding the following line as the user who is going to use
the program:

*/30 * * * * fusesmbcache &> /dev/null

than you're ready to run:

fusermount <mountpoint> fusesmb

or:

fusesmb <mountpoint>

If your network needs authentication you can add a file:

~/.smb/credentials

with the following two lines:

username = <username>
password = <password>

Both the network scanner - fusesmbcache - and fusesmb will then use this
file for authentication.

You can now browse the network!

Have fun!
